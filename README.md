# VIZ-of-Deaths
In this visualization, a bar chart is created to analyze the distribution of two continuous variables — Infant Deaths and Life Expectancy — across multiple countries (Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola) over time. The data is grouped by day, month, quarter, and year, allowing for a temporal comparison of these health indicators.
