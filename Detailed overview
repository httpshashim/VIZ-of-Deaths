Project Description: Bar Chart Visualization of Infant Deaths and Life Expectancy
In this visualization, a bar chart is created to analyze the distribution of two continuous variables — Infant Deaths and Life Expectancy — across multiple countries (Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola) over time. The data is grouped by day, month, quarter, and year, allowing for a temporal comparison of these health indicators.

Light Blue Bars represent the Sum of Infant Deaths, a key indicator of public health issues in each country.

Dark Blue Bars represent the Sum of Life Expectancy, which reflects the overall health and living conditions of the population.

The x-axis is categorized by country and date, which serves as a combination of both categorical (country) and time-based variables. The y-axis shows the total counts or values for each respective metric.

This bar chart effectively allows us to:

Compare the health performance between different countries.

Observe trends over time, such as increases or decreases in infant deaths or life expectancy.

Identify countries with extreme values, which may require further investigation or targeted intervention.

The visualization was created using Tableau, a data visualization tool that enables interactive exploration and effective presentation of complex data.
